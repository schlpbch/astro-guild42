# Fintech – Made in Switzerland
January 25 @ 18:00 - 19:00

Relai is the easiest way to invest in Bitcoin in Europe. As a fast growing startup we decided to rely on JS technology heavily. The Relai mobile app is developed in React Native and available for both iOS and Android platforms. The Relai back-end is powered by ExpressJS and hosted on Jelastic cloud to allow quick scaling solutions. Security is a core principle of Relai as we are dealing with our user’s finances. Our second main topic is performance. We are currently working on our scaling solutions with Kubernetes and Docker containers and automating the whole process with CI/CD workflows. During my talk I will be presenting the early days of the Relai project and how we became more secure and stable over time by relying on best practices in the industry.

## Speakers

Adem Bilican, CTO @Relai_ch

Already while he was studying Bioinformatics at the University of Bern,Breathwas more interested in informatics than in biology. Soon after he completed his PhD, he got into software engineering, more specifically into mobile app development. He started his own software development companyCansultingwhere he developed own applications like canSnippet, and customer applications (mostly for startups) like Klindoo. For 3-4 years he is now specialised in bringing blockchain applications to the mobile world. He worked on big foundation-funded blockchain projects like the Quantum Resistent Ledger and Elastos, before becoming the CTO ofRelay: the world’s easiest bitcoin investing app made in Switzerland.

Julian Liniger, CEO @Relai_ch

After studying Psychology and Business Administration, Julian discovered his passion for tech entrepreneurship. His doing-mentality led him to work in banking and management consulting next to his studies, and he already co-founded the consulting boutique Bravis before completing his Master’s degree. Early in 2015, when Bitcoin was only known by Tech Nerds, Julian got interested in Bitcoin and started experimenting with and investing in it. Late in 2018 he realized that investing in Bitcoin was still way too complicated for everyday people, so he founded and now serves as CEO of Relai: the world’s easiest bitcoin investing app made in Switzerland.

# Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) – What is that?

November 16 @ 18:00 - 19:00

Reliability is usually not the highest priority when it comes to creating software. In operation, more so. However, there is still a clear separation here (even in the age of DevOps), because reliability is considered an operational problem. Very few people have a clear idea of what the desired availability should be, how it is measured and what happens if it is not met.

To answer these questions, Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) provides a clear framework for addressing reliability in the product life cycle. Reliability is treated as a "First Class Citizen" and not as "Oh, yesterday we had a problem in production, I think we have to do something". We'll also look at how SRE fits into the DevOps world.

## The speaker

In his professional life, Florian Kammermann has worked in many different IT areas. Florian is interested in everything (process, technology, human aspects) that makes software development faster, more valuable and more transparent. He is currently working at Swisscom on a DevOps portal where DevOps engineers can manage all the resources they need (tools, infrastructure) as self-service. The tools of choice to achieve the goals are Golang, Angular, Cloud Foundry, and Kubernetes. Florian is also part of the SRE Community of Practice, which implements SRE practices at Swisscom.

# Serverless Java #slideless

September 14 @ 18:00 - 19:30

What is serverless?
Can we use Java for serverless?
Can a Java application ship as a function?
What are the killer use cases for serverless applications?
How to develop Java functions locally?
Are functions “cheap”?
In this session, Adam Bien is going to explain the serverless concepts with working code and concepts (and no slides).

## Speaker

Developer, Consultant, Author, Podcaster (https://airhacks.fm) and Java enthusiast Adam Bien (https://adambien.blog) uses Java since JDK 1.0 and JavaScript since LiveScript and still enjoys writing code. Adam regularly organizes Java / Web / Architectures online live workshops https://airhacks.live and monthly Q&A live streaming show: https://airhacks.tv.

# An Introduction to Rust
June 22 @ 18:00 - 19:00

As is well known, many things can change quickly in the technology sector. Except for the technology area, it is called "embedded software", where the 50-year-old C programming language is primarily used.

Since then, several language candidates have tried to gain a foothold in the embedded sector. Mostly with moderate success.

With Rust, another candidate has joined in recent years. Rust was developed by Mozilla in 2010 and has since become the most popular programming language ever, according to the Annual Stackoverflow Developer Survey 2019.

Thanks to its features, Rust has also won the hearts of some embedded systems developers.

So the questions arise:

- How was Rust able to generate such a great deal of interest in such a short time?
- What can Rust offer in the embedded sector?
- What are the advantages and disadvantages compared to existing technologies?
- What can be expected from Rust in the future?

## The speaker

Samuel Schüpbach is enthusiastic about using emerging technologies such as Rust or Docker in combination with Linux to develop embedded products and improve processes. Inspired by the open source movement and driven to advance open source technologies with their own contributions.

He enjoys spending time in the mountains, traveling or getting to know foreign cultures and cuisines.

Samuel studied electrical engineering at the Bern University of Applied Sciences with a specialization in embedded systems.

# GraalVM

15. June 2020 @ 18:00 - 19:00

Oracle's GraalVM offers a wide range of applications. Be it building native Java applications, running polyglot applications or using the Graal JIT compiler for better performance. The speakers explain how GraalVM works and its limitations. They show in which situations the switch to GraalVM can be useful.

In addition, the Quarkus framework, which is being developed in the GraalVM environment, is discussed. Of course, a comparison with the top dog Spring Boot should not be missing.

## The speakers

Matthias Baumeler and Niroj Mahalingam are application engineers at the Swiss Federal Railways SBB.

# Is that still agile?

April 20, 2020 @ 18:00 - 19:00

Something is rotten in the state of Denmark. In the beginning everything sounded so good, but now something seems to be wrong anymore...

- Why doesn't agility work?
- Are we balanced and happy?
- Is the software quality better?
- Can you be old and agile?
- Does everything scale?
- What do all these philologists actually do in the software projects?

More and more approaches are emerging that claim to be agile. Depending on their origin, knowledge, interest and intention, they are very different and contradictory – yes, some even esoteric. This creates a new field of tension, which is the opposite of what was actually intended. Let's try not to lose track, keep the good principles and find out how to recognize and maybe even correct false agility.

## The speaker

Danilo Biella is a demystifier and likes to question things. He advises in various areas of IT projects, from practices in software manufacturing to efficient principles in project processes. His passion is to make the customer better in the implementation of his projects. Since his master's degree in computer science, his focus has been on quality aspects in software development – and even though his tireless fight for more quality awareness continues, the focus has shifted towards software process analysis in the last decade. On his 20-year journey, he has gained experience in multi-continental projects on a wide variety of technologies.

In his free time, he likes to play card and board games, he makes music and philosophizes over and about wine.
