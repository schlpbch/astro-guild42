Data usually lives longer than the associated applications. This is just one of many reasons why it is important to have a very good database solution in use.

The most common data stores are either NoSQL aor SQL databases. When it comes to which data storage to choose for a project, there are many myths and half-truths. Some arguments for and against are also very emotional.

In this talk we take a look at these myths and facts such as performance, scalability, monitoring and other software engineering aspects of NoSQL and SQL databases. We refute some of them, confirm others and take a rational look at the characteristics of various database solutions.

At the end of the talk you should know how to find the right database solution for your use case.
