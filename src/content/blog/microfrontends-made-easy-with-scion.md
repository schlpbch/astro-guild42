In recent years we have observed great dynamics in web frameworks, which poses major challenges, especially for large and long-lasting enterprise applications. New frameworks come onto the market and others are discontinued almost every day. In order to defuse the short-lived nature of technologies and to be able to react to changes as flexibly as possible, a trend has developed towards small, independent web applications, the so-called micro frontend.

In this talk we would like to give an introduction to the world of micro frontend and address possible integration techniques and challenges. We will introduce the [SCION framework](https://github.com/SchweizerischeBundesbahnen/scion-microfrontend-platform), which supports the implementation of a micro frontend-based architecture. SCION was born out of necessity and promises the highest possible isolation with minimal dependency on a framework. Hands-on, we will integrate several example applications using SCION.

Finally, theory meets practice - we share our experiences with micro frontend architectures at SBB using the example of two applications in the areas of sales and planning.
