Something is rotten in the state of Denmark. In the beginning everything sounded so good, but now something seems to be wrong anymore...

- Why doesn't agility work?
- Are we balanced and happy?
- Is the software quality better?
- Can you be old and agile?
- Does everything scale?
- What do all these philologists actually do in the software projects?

More and more approaches are emerging that claim to be agile. Depending on their origin, knowledge, interest and intention, they are very different and contradictory – yes, some even esoteric. This creates a new field of tension, which is the opposite of what was actually intended. Let's try not to lose track, keep the good principles and find out how to recognize and maybe even correct false agility.
