The era of Angular, React and Vue as classic single page applications is over. The trend in modern web frameworks leads back to the server. [React Server Components](https://vercel.com/blog/understanding-react-server-components) are currently the most prominent example of how modern web development is finding its way back to the server. React Server Components could be the next revolution in front-end development, and other frameworks will have to compete with them in the future.

This talk shows how React Server Components work, what problems they address and what new challenges they create when developing web applications. We also take a closer look at the full-stack ambitions of other modern frontend frameworks (Remix, Svelte, Solid, Astro, Blazor ...) and show how they implement similar concepts. We will see that these can be considered a “prior art” for React Server Components.
