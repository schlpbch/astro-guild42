Oracle's [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) offers a wide range of applications. Be it building native Java applications, running polyglot applications or using the Graal JIT compiler for better performance. The speakers explain how GraalVM works and its limitations. They show in which situations the switch to GraalVM can be useful.

In addition, the [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) framework, which is being developed in the GraalVM environment, is discussed. Of course, a comparison with the top dog Spring Boot should not be missing.

## Speakers
