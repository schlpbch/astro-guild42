As is well known, many things can change quickly in the technology sector. Except for the technology area of embedded software, where the 50-year-old C programming language is still primarily used.

Several new language candidates have tried to gain a foothold in the embedded sector. Mostly with moderate success.

With the [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) another candidate has joined in recent years. Rust was developed by Mozilla in 2010 and has since become the most popular programming language ever, according to the Annual Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019.

Thanks to its features, Rust has also won the hearts of some embedded systems developers.

So the questions arise:

- How was Rust able to generate such a great deal of interest in such a short time?
- What can Rust offer in the embedded sector?
- What are the advantages and disadvantages compared to existing technologies?
- What can be expected from Rust in the future?

## Speaker

[Samuel Schüpbach](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-schuepbach/) is enthusiastic about using emerging technologies such as Rust or Docker in combination with Linux to develop embedded products and improve processes. Inspired by the open source movement and driven to advance open source technologies with their own contributions.

He enjoys spending time in the mountains, traveling or getting to know foreign cultures and cuisines.

Samuel studied electrical engineering at the Bern University of Applied Sciences with a specialization in embedded systems.
