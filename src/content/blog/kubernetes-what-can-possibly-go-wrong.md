More and more companies are relying on container technologies such as Docker or Podman. In order to operate this efficiently and in production, an orchestration solution is used - the decision is now almost always made in favor of Kubernetes. Kubernetes offers a lot, but has a steep learning curve and practically requires a modern DevOps organization with everything that goes with it. Safety is often neglected, which can have catastrophic consequences.

In this talk, we shed light on common misunderstandings, errors and the potential regarding the security of Kubernetes environments. How absolute is the separation between namespaces? Why do I need admission controllers? Which permissions are critical? What's the point of a read-only file system? We answer these and similar questions. Last but not least, we look at the organizational challenges, as technology alone cannot solve all potential security problems. The aim of the lecture is to give participants an overview of central security aspects in the context of Kubernetes and, in particular, to enable software developers and architects to further increase security.
