In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, [Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) have emerged as a transformative technology, capable of understanding and generating human-like text. This talk will explore how software developers can harness the power of LLMs to enhance their applications, delivering smarter, more intuitive user experiences.

We will begin with an overview of what LLMs are, including popular models like GPT-4 and Gemini, and how they function.

Next, we will delve into practical applications, demonstrating how LLMs can be integrated into various domains such as customer support, content creation, and personalized recommendations.

Attendees will gain insights into best practices for integrating LLMs, covering aspects like API usage, fine-tuning models for specific tasks, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM-Agents and ensuring data privacy and ethical considerations.

Whether you are developing web applications, mobile apps, or enterprise solutions, this talk will provide you with the knowledge and tools needed to leverage LLMs effectively.

## Speaker

Data systems, particularly search systems, have been a constant presence throughout [Ursula Deriu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ursuladeriu/)’s professional life since her studies. She has held a variety of roles, including software engineer, project manager, and line manager. For many years, she has been teaching her specialist areas at various Swiss universities of applied sciences. Additionally, as the owner of [Tirsus](http://www.tirsus.com), she develops online courses and advises companies.

The development of search systems has been the common thread running through her career. She is delighted that search systems are currently experiencing a revival thanks to generative AI. This revival is only possible due to well-designed data systems, bringing together the various strands of her expertise into a cohesive whole.
