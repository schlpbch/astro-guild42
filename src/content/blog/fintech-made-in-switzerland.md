[Relai](https://relai.app/) is the easiest way to invest in Bitcoin in Europe. As a fast growing startup we decided to rely on JS technology heavily. The Relai mobile app is developed in _React Native_ and available for both iOS and Android platforms. The Relai back-end is powered by _ExpressJS_ and hosted on _Jelastic_ cloud to allow quick scaling solutions. Security is a core principle of Relai as we are dealing with our user’s finances. Our second main topic is performance. We are currently working on our scaling solutions with Kubernetes and Docker containers and automating the whole process with CI/CD workflows. During the talk we will be presenting the early days of the Relai project and how we became more secure and stable over time by relying on best practices in the industry.

## Speakers

Already while he was studying Bioinformatics at the University of Bern, CTO [Adem Bilican](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adem-bilican-9a808a126/) was more interested in informatics than in biology. Soon after he completed his PhD, he got into software engineering, more specifically into mobile app development. He started his own software development company Cansulting where he developed own applications like _canSnippet_, and customer applications (mostly for startups) like _Klindoo_. For 3-4 years he is now specialized in bringing blockchain applications to the mobile world. He worked on big foundation-funded blockchain projects like the _Quantum Resistent Ledger_ and _Elastos_, before becoming the CTO ofRelay.

After studying Psychology and Business Administration, CEO [Julian Liniger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julianliniger/) discovered his passion for tech entrepreneurship. His doing-mentality led him to work in banking and management consulting next to his studies, and he already co-founded the consulting boutique _Bravis_ before completing his Master’s degree. Early in 2015, when Bitcoin was only known by Tech Nerds, Julian got interested in Bitcoin and started experimenting with and investing in it. Late in 2018 he realized that investing in Bitcoin was still way too complicated for everyday people, so he founded and now serves as CEO of Relai.
