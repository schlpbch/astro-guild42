description: This talk shares the experiences of working with Firebase's backend-as-a-service (BaaS) model during the development of Coop’s WeNeed app.
---

During this presentation we share our experiences of working with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)'s [backend-as-a-service (BaaS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backend_as_a_service) model during the development of Coop’s [WeNeed](https://weneed.ch/) app. We will have an in-depth look at the technical challenges we needed to overcome and the limitations and advantages of Firebase and the BaaS model in general.

The goal of this presentation is to hopefully provide enough insight, so that colleagues can make an informed decision on whether Firebase or the BaaS model is the right fit for their project.
