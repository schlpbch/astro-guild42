This presentation and discussion provides a concise overview of current trends and platforms in open source software, highlighting success stories and lessons learned from Switzerland. It introduces developments such as openDesk and openCode by the Centre for Digital Sovereignty (ZenDiS), European cloud initiatives, and the SDS – Souveräne Digitale Schweiz network, all of which advance digital sovereignty and are highly relevant to Switzerland’s IT landscape.

The talk also addresses the Federal Act on the Use of Electronic Means for the Performance of Government Tasks (EMBAG), which came into force in 2024. EMBAG establishes the legal framework for the federal administration’s digital transformation, with principles such as digital first, open by default for government data, and a strong emphasis on open source and interoperability.
Together, these initiatives and frameworks illustrate how open technologies and legal foundations strengthen digital sovereignty and foster innovation in Switzerland.

The talk will be held in German with some Bernese sprinkled in.
