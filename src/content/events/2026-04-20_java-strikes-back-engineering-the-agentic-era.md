AI systems are moving beyond prompts to agents that plan, act and interact. And this time, Java is not catching up, it’s leading. Frameworks like LangChain4j and Embabel bring agentic capabilities with the strengths Java is built on: type safety, structure, reliability and testability.
Agents aren’t a passing hype. They are a necessary design pattern for robust AI systems, enforcing separation of concerns, controlled execution flows and human-in-the-loop checkpoints. They make complex AI interactions predictable, auditable and production ready.
This talk shows how the Java ecosystem is turning agentic design into a disciplined engineering approach, and how you can start replacing suitable parts of your processes using agents in a practical, production-ready way.

The talk will be held in English.

### Speaker

[Lize Raes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lize-raes-a8a34110/) loves helping developers to bring AI into real-world applications. As Developer Advocate for Java + AI at Oracle and collaborator at LangChain4j, she’s invested into making cutting-edge tech accessible and useful for developers. Her path has taken her from cochlear implant research to advising the Belgian government during COVID-19, to bioinformatics for drug development. Lize likes her projects hands-on and slightly unconventional, especially when they help make the world a bit better. Outside of work, you’ll find her behind the piano or in her woodworking atelier.
