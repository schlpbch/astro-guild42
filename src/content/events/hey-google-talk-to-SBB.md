Siri? Alexa? Google Assistant? There is more and more talk about such digital assistants. But what does it mean to use such a platform and implement innovative products on it?

[SBB](https://www.sbb.ch/en), together with [Paixon](https://www.paixon.ch) has developed one of the first voice assistants for Switzerland based on the Google Assistant platform. The **SBB Voice Assistant** provides information on connections, trains and delays and allows you to buy a ticket by voice. The decisive factor for the Google ecosystem was the availability of the technology on every mobile phone in Switzerland and the Google Nest speakers.

In this talk, we want to develop a hands-on Google Action and thus show the challenges that such a project entails.
