### Episode 2, it couldn't get any worse

Three years ago we asked ourselves “Is this still agile?”, but it has now become clear what the answer is.

- How could that happen?
- What have we started?
- Aren't we the good guys after all?
- How could we fail again?
- Where did we take a wrong turn?

It looks like a lot of people have lost hope in being able to work in Agile.

Transformations are perceived as being determined by others and the reaction is resistance.

Only process people show joy and celebrate themselves, claqueurs alike.

The question arises as to whether the agilists themselves live the agile values.

We will get to the bottom of the matter and name possible suspects.
