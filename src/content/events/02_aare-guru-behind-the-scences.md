Since 2015 [Aare Guru](https://aare.guru) provide informations about swimming conditions for the Aare river and, inadvertently, an oulet for lovers and haters of the Bernese language as well. This talk will give you an insight into the tech stack of our pretty successful little side project. We will cover the history & architecture, what we're doing with Blockchain (Spoiler: Nothing), what we're doing with AI (Spoiler: Almost nothing) and how we're using the organizational pattern of mutually assured destruction to keep running the project interesting.

The talk will be held in German with some Bernese sprinkled in.

### Speaker

[Christian Studer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-studer-715073ab/) is a software engineer by day and sleeping at night. He works at Codeblock, a software consultancy here in Bern. Between his work and family, he occasionally finds time to work on a series of side projects. Or is going for a swim. No wonder his sprint times are measured in years.
