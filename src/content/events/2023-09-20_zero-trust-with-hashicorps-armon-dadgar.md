Zero trust security is predicated on securing everything based on trusted identities. Machine authentication and authorization, machine-to-machine access, human authentication and authorization, and human-to-machine access are the four foundational categories for identity-driven controls and zero trust security. The transition from traditional on-premises data centers and environments to dynamic, cloud infrastructure is complex and introduces new challenges for enterprise security.

This shift requires a different approach to security, a different trust model. One that trusts nothing and authenticates and authorizes everything. Because of the highly dynamic environment, organizations talk about a “zero trust” approach to cloud security. What does “zero trust” actually mean and what’s required for you to make it successful?

Attend this event and you’ll learn from [Armon Dadgar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/armon-dadgar/), [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/)’s Co-Founder and CTO, how your organization can enable scalable, dynamic security across clouds. He will show you, how you can contribute with your day to day work to a Zero Trust within your organization.
