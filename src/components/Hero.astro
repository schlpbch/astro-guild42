  <h1>Guild 42</h1>
  <p>
    We organize events in Bern on topics related to the field of software
    development. The focus is on the exchange of knowledge and experience for
    software developers and software development companies, both on the
    professional as well as on the personal level.
  </p>
  <p>
    We believe that this initiative increases the attractiveness of Bern as a
    location for software development companies.
